# Year1_CS16X
All labs and assigments from CS16X series at Oregon State. 
Term1 is CS160 which was done using haskell. 
Term2 is CS161 which was done using C++ (but it was basically just C). 
Finally, Term3 is CS162 which was done using C++ except for the last assignment which was done in C (again, the whole class was basically done in C cause we weren't really allowed to use a lot of the helpful functionality of C++).
