All strings with at least one 'a' over the alphabet {a,b}
S -> KDK
K -> bK|lambda|aK
D -> a

All strings no consecutive 0's over the alphabet {0,1}
S -> AB
A -> 0C|lambda
B -> 1B|lambda|1A
C -> 1A

Based on the grammar:
S -> aS|aSbS|lambda
Construct all the derivation trees for the following strings:

aab:
                        ___S____
                       /  / \   \
                       a  S  b  S
                         / \    |
                        a   S  lambda
                            |
